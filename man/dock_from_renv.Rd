\description{
Create a Dockerfile from an `renv.lock` file
}
\details{
System requirements for packages are provided through RStudio Package Manager via the {pak} package. The install commands provided from pak are added as `RUN` directives within the `Dockerfile`.

The R version is taken from the `renv.lock` file. Packages are installed using `renv::restore()` which ensures that the proper package version and source is used when installed.

By default, `dock_from_renv()` will utilize the [public RStudio Package Manager](https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/) (PPM) to provide linux binaries. This dramatically improves install time. This is done when `use_rspm = TRUE`.  To do so, a new file `renv.lock.dock` will be created so as to not overwrite your existing `renv.lock` file. This new `renv.lock.dock` file is used to build the Docker image with PPM binaries.
